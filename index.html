              <p>Keep Safe Essex is working across Essex to make a difference for vulnerable people.  The Keep Safe scheme has already helped more than 3,000 people including people with a learning disability, older people and people with mental ill health in Essex to feel safer in their towns and communities.</p>
              <p>There are in excess of 400 Keep Safe venues across town centres in Essex, and by carrying Keep Safe cards and key rings or key tags which show essential telephone numbers, vulnerable people who feel unwell, unsafe or disorientated can go to a Keep Safe venue and ask for help to contact someone they trust. The free scheme has received dedicated support from local traders and businesses offering to act as Keep Safe venues and displaying the Keep Safe logo, as well as support from local authorities and community organisations.</p>
              <p>Keep Safe was first launched by the CAVS Be Safer Project and Braintree District Council in 2012 and has been so successful that it has been replicated in town centres  across Essex. Keep Safe card holders can now visit areas away from their home towns and enjoy even more independence, knowing that they can call on a Keep Safe venue, if needed.</p>
