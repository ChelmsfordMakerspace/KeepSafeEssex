# Keep Safe Essex
The source code to Keep Safe Essex's website.

## Contributions
Contributions to this project are welcome! Get in touch via. GitHub issues to discuss major changes or simply open a pull request for minor fixes.

## Data
Data is pulled from data/postcodes.json and data/regionalOffices.json. The postcodes file attempts to best match postcodes to their regions while regionalOffices holds the contact information of each regional coordinator. This cuts down on the data duplication seen in the original spreadsheet that seeded these files.
